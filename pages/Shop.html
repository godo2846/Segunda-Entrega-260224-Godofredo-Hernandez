                    <h3>Yoga Bricks</h3>
                    <p>Yoga blocks and bricks are used to assist in yoga practices. Usually, yoga bricks are used for stability and bringing the floor closer, as well as helping you build your flexibility and ease into more challenging poses. Yoga blocks are used for sitting, supporting the hips in restorative yoga positions as well as reducing pressure on your muscles and joints, helping with your overall alignment. Yoga bricks are made of firm materials like cork or foam, and are smooth to ensure a comfortable grip.</p>

                    <h3>Yoga Towel</h3>
                    <p>Yoga towels absorb and trap the moisture so it doesn't spread on the surface of the mat, and their dense microfibers keep the surface secure, so you have a sturdy foundation under you. Many people prefer to spread a yoga towel on top of their yoga mat regardless of the yoga variety they're practicing.</p>
